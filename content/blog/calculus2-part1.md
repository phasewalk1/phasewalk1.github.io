summary: Ways To Think About Slicing Methods

the first section of my Calculus II class is centered around integration. specifically, using integration methods to find the volume of some arbitrary shape. of course, we know how to trivially calculate volumes for novel shapes--things like cubes, cylinders, and pyramids. but how can we calculate the volume of shapes that form from bounded regions between two curves, and how do we do all this in only _two_ dimensions?

Calculus II sidesteps this problem of being a dimension short by a concept coined _Solids of Revolution_. these solids are true 3-dimensional objects, formed by rotating a 2-dimensional shape around a line or axis. this may seem confusing, considering we are still working on a 2-dimension plane; i've found that it helps me understand the concept better if i instead, imagine the _z_-axis as still being there, but that it's _invisible_ and thus, we do not need to define it explicitly nor worry about it at all.
