### Who Am I

hi, i'm kat and i'm a 20 year old undergraduate here at Diablo Valley College, Ca. i began my junior college education pursuing a computer science degree, and completed the entire A.S. path before realizing that i really like mathematics, specifically, _pure_ mathematics. recently i decided to pivot my major to a mathematics path, yielding a great benefit to me in knowing that the world's best programs for mathematics are regularly less than half as competitive as the equally reputable computer science programs. while i consider myself to be a programmer in sprit, i still do not yet consider myself a mathematician. this semester being my first real taste of pure mathematics, in the form of one course _Discrete Mathematics_, which discusses formal logic, digital circuits, set theory, number theory, methods of proof, proof-writing, graph theory, etc. . alongside this course, i'm also taking Calculus II, and Object-oriented C++ (i'm actually only taking this one to fulfill an on-campus requirement that obligates any CS tutor to have taken this course; i'd like to tutor.). before transferring to a UC in the fall of 2024, i will complete the following courses:

[x] - Discrete Mathematics (current)

[x] - Calculus II (current)

[ ] - Linear Algebra

[ ] - Calculus III

[ ] - Differential Equations

outside of school, i'm interested in all sorts of things. staying on the topic of math and cs, i'm recently most captivated by machine learning, and the hard problems that surround _data engineering_ and _agent alignment_. i also find my way into more niche interests, like distributed systems, programing languages, systems programming, cybersecurity (mainly red team ops.) and cryptography. i have a strong philosophy about code, how it should be used, shared, and distributed. my own philosophy runs adjacent to the _FOSS_ mantra, and i've never written a single line of _closed-source_ code, nor do i plan to. this may be problematic for many; maybe you have a nice job at a tech company, working on a proprietary product who's source is barred, and while my respect is not lost on you for it, i refuse to put myself in that same position.

### Hobbies

stepping back from the mathematics and computer science underworld .. i find myself having distractingly many interests that lay completely above surface, relative to my field of study. more often than not, on my days off (which are few and far between), i find myself spending most of the day with my guitar and many pedals. when i'm not writing songs, i'll catch myself listening to bands i enjoy most, or seeking out new ones. in the winter, i like to skii--and just generally, explore the snow, for it brings me immense peace. when i'm not doing any of these things, i'm usually on some sort of adventure. long hikes with snacks and a good book, or drives on backroads with no one destination.

### What Animates Me

i consider myself to be an amateur rationalist, transhumanist, and accelerationist. i want to spend my life working on hard problems that make real impacts on the flourishment of humanity. what does the human of 2090 look like? how can we ensure that the future is everything we want it to be and more?

i ask these questions to you because they are the questions that drive me. will i be laying in a hospital bed in 2090, or will i be just as youthful as i was when writing this? will the future be full of magic and wonder, or will there be no future at all?

to ensure the future is exciting and playful, i believe that one cannot simply entrust others to make it so for them. i got into this field because it's where the builders are, and i want to have a voice in our future. instead of naively hoping that our future is bright, i've decided to pursue knowledge that equips me with the skills necessary to play a part in making it bright.

### What You Can Expect Here

**deepmeow** is my personal site with no strict posting schedule, or format, nor does it abide by any one topic. i've published this site on my github primarily as a means for new acquaintances to get to know me a little better; but also, to document interesting work i might find myself doing, or new things i may be learning. primarily, **deepmeow** will house blogs adjacent to _mathematics_ (pure and applied), _computer science_ (theory, data structures, programming languages, compilers, infra.), _systems_ (hardware, distributed systems), and reserves the right to post about any personal hobbies or interests in conjunction with more technical writings.
